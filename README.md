### Hello welcome to my github page
I am a Final Year Undergraduate of Electrical Engineering @ IIT Kharagpur and aspiring Software Engineer.  
I am quite passionate about Competitive Programming . A quick learner, a chess lover, and an avid reader I believe, my best ability is adaptability. Apart from software and math, stuff I enjoy are watching loads of anime (https://myanimelist.net/animelist/abhj), reading manga (https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/abhj), listening to David Guetta and watching documentaries for hours.  
My public portfolio page is https://abhj.github.io/public-portfolio where you know more about me.
